/**
 calculates exams average mark
 A class of students took an exam. Develop an application that takes an
 arbitrary number of marks (i.e. we do not know the exact number of marks,
 that is the user decides when there are no marks to be entered) and calculates
 and displays the average mark of the entire class on the exam. The marks
 are integers in the range [0,100].
 TODO: Compile, then run the application to test it for different marks values.
